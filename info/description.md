You are given the lengths for each side on a triangle.
You need to find all three angles for this triangle.
If the given side lengths cannot form a triangle (or form a degenerated triangle),
then you must return all angles as 0 (zero).
The angles should be represented as a list of integers in **ascending order**.
Each angle is measured in degrees and rounded to the nearest integer number (Standard mathematical rounding).
